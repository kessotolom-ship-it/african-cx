This information may then be intercepted by threat actors using sniffer tools or interception techniques such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks (often involving social engineering). Attackers can then use information gleaned to perform a variety of actions, depending on the information type. Possible actions include gaining unauthorized access, impersonating a user, moving laterally within the organization's network, or retrieving and potentially modifying files. This weakness is almost completely avoidable through intelligent architecture and design.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Build web applications around a security mindset and the awareness that sniffers may be present at any time.\n* Ensure that all sensitive data transmission uses reliable encryption.\n* Implement security measures so that sensitive results are never returned in plain text.\n* Implement multiple-factor authentication methods to validate remote instances.\n* Use SSL not only at logon but throughout communications.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["javascript","HttpToHttps","Security"],"categories": ["Security"],"exampleCommitFixes": [{"commitURL": "https://github.com/REBELinBLUE/deployer/commit/bdb2c9750c497c9bc025580ce5bf5b8a6972de17?diff=split#diff-112ac233b1e3314b31d86e70dd54fd358cf3e246c38a63bf2e3085a47a0d6cf3L-1","lines": [{"line": "var redis = new Redis();\n","lineNumber": 9,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "var redis = new Redis({\n","lineNumber": 9,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    db: ENV.REDIS_DATBASE || 0\n","lineNumber": 10,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "});\n","lineNumber": 11,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 12,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "if (!/^https/i.test(process.env.SOCKET_URL)) {\n","lineNumber": 13,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 14,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    var ssl_conf = {\n","lineNumber": 15,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "        key:  (process.env.SOCKET_SSL_KEY_FILE  ? fs.readFileSync(process.env.SOCKET_SSL_KEY_FILE)  : null),\n","lineNumber": 16,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "        cert: (process.env.SOCKET_SSL_CERT_FILE ? fs.readFileSync(process.env.SOCKET_SSL_CERT_FILE) : null),\n","lineNumber": 17,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "        ca:   (process.env.SOCKET_SSL_CA_FILE   ? fs.readFileSync(process.env.SOCKET_SSL_CA_FILE)   : null)\n","lineNumber": 18,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    };\n","lineNumber": 19,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 20,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    var app = require('https').createServer(ssl_conf, handler);\n","lineNumber": 21,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "} else {\n","lineNumber": 22,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "    var app = require('http').createServer(handler);\n","lineNumber": 23,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "}\n","lineNumber": 24,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/medic/couch2pg/commit/062eaa0f53d2cd2327232a695c60bf4c9fd589f6?diff=split#diff-e727e4bdf3657fd1d798edcd6b099d6e092f8573cba266154583a746bba0f346L-1","lines": [{"line": "var httplib = require('http');\n","lineNumber": 1,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "var httplib = require('https');\n","lineNumber": 1,"lineChange": "added"}]},{"commitURL": "https://github.com/Rich-Harris/packd/commit/c14d17da80ed075ee007de3121422fb2c5b77e4d?diff=split#diff-1821d11fbffbab2187701c42616688d46bf66d7b2cf6eaf363548dd66caa6ebaL-1","lines": [{"line": "const http = require( 'http' );\n","lineNumber": 0,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "const https = require( 'https' );\n","lineNumber": 0,"lineChange": "added"},{"line": "\n","lineNumber": 1,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "module.exports = function get ( url ) {\n","lineNumber": 2,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\treturn new Promise( ( fulfil, reject ) => {\n","lineNumber": 3,"lineChange": "none"},{"line": "\t\thttp.get( url, response => {\n","lineNumber": 4,"lineChange": "removed"},{"line": "\t\thttps.get( url, response => {\n","lineNumber": 4,"lineChange": "added"}]}],"exampleCommitDescriptions": [],"precision": "very-high","repoDatasetSize": 122,"cwe": ["CWE-319"]}}]}},"results": [{"ruleId": "javascript/HttpToHttps","ruleIndex": 0,"level": "warning","message": {"text":"request uses HTTP which is an insecure protocol and should not be used in code due to cleartext transmission of information.
